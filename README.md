Subnautica Below Zero game mod aimed at:
- Change the storyline and patch plot holes
- Modifying the map to return to horror/horror elements and more distinctive, larger biomes that transition seamlessly from one to another
- Modifying the occurrence of plants and animals so that they make sense considering the environment and their established biology
- Removing/modifying elements that don't make sense after considering the rules of the world in the previous game

## Why
I played the original game years ago and played Subnautica Below Zero in mid-2024 after two years of release. And after finishing the game, I have to say only one thing: I'm disappointed. 

I have the impression that the developers put a lot of work and passion into creating the plants, the animals, the world - but they ran out of time. The story is poor and has a lot of plot holes, the map is small and hard to navigate, the biomes transition unnaturally one into another, the plants are too many and often each plant is found everywhere else, similarly the animals, etc. After going through the entire storyline, I was overstimulated and felt like I was playing more of an assetflip based on assets from subnautica and not a new game.

And I decided that I would try my hand at modding and maybe I could change that. I hope to create a version of the game that will make me, and maybe others, happy.
