Subnautica Below Zero game mod aimed at:
- Change the storyline and patch plot holes
- Modifying the map to return to horror/horror elements and more distinctive, larger biomes that transition seamlessly from one to another
- Modifying the occurrence of plants and animals so that they make sense considering the environment and their established biology
- Removing/modifying elements that don't make sense after considering the rules of the world in the previous game




## Why
I played the original game years ago and played Subnautica Below Zero in mid-2024 after two years of release. And after finishing the game, I have to say only one thing: I'm disappointed. 

I have the impression that the developers put a lot of work and passion into creating the plants, the animals, the world - but they ran out of time. The story is poor and has a lot of plot holes, the map is small and hard to navigate, the biomes transition unnaturally one into another, the plants are too many and often each plant is found everywhere else, similarly the animals, etc. After going through the entire storyline, I was overstimulated and felt like I was playing more of an assetflip based on assets from subnautica and not a new game.

And I decided that I would try my hand at modding and maybe I could change that. I hope to create a version of the game that will make me, and maybe others, happy.
## New Storyline
One of the inspirations for creating this mod was the video [Subnautica Below Zero Review - Why doesn't it hold up?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-AWFjBONp8) by Ugly Fish, at the end of which the author proposed a new plot that I liked.
#### Plot Summary
Sam discovers that Altera is conducting tests on the bacteria and finds proof that it could be weaponized. Using her background in robotics, she decides to rig a fabricator to neutralize the bacteria instead of conjuring up a cure (its easier to neutralize dead leviatan body). She creates schematics for a prawn suit upgrade to cook the bacteria, but Altera gets wise to her plans. They isolate her at Outpost Zero, now relocated to the Lilypad Islands. Sam hides evidence of Altera's dealings in various undersea bases and hidden caches, knowing that her sister Robin might come looking for her.

Around this time, Marguerit Maida arrives at Sector Zero, battered and desperate. Altera offers her supplies in exchange for hunting down Sam, which she reluctantly agrees to. This explains the destroyed underwater bases as Marguerit chases Sam. Sam goes deeper into the ocean to avoid Marguerit and continue developing the technology, but she is eventually caught and killed by Marguerit before she can complete it.

Altera replaces their team with a more professional, discreet group. Enter Robin, who lands during a meteor storm, delaying the Altera crew. Robin investigates the abandoned bases, finding Sam's caches with evidence against Altera. She needs to develop the technology to kill the bacteria herself before Altera returns. Robin eventually contacts Marguerit, who, feeling guilty for her actions, offers her prawn suit technology to help Robin go deeper.

Robin needs a power source for the prawn suit laser. Alan, an alien, contacts her from the bottom of the ocean, offering a special ion cube in exchange for helping him build a body. Alan's motives are ambiguous, and his role in the Kara outbreak is kept vague. Robin helps him, wondering if she made the right choice. With the technology complete, Robin fulfills Sam's wishes by neutralizing the bacteria and keeping it out of Altera's hands.

Robin and Marguerit hack the radio tower to contact the independent Mongolian states, organizing a rescue. The Mongolian states retrieve Robin in exchange for the evidence against Altera, which they can use for political leverage. Marguerit gets her redemption, and all characters have clear, reasonable motives.

#### Reasons the Plot Makes Sense
- Sam's Background: Sam's expertise in robotics makes her efforts to rig a fabricator to neutralize the bacteria plausible.
- Evidence of Altera's Dealings: Sam's actions to hide evidence align with her awareness of Altera's dangerous activities.
- Marguerit's Desperation: Marguerit's agreement to hunt Sam in exchange for supplies fits her desperate situation.
- Robin's Investigation: Robin's exploration of the abandoned bases and finding clues about Sam's fate provides a natural progression of the story.
- Technology Development: The need for Robin to use both Sam's plans and Marguerit's technology to complete the prawn suit makes her journey logical and challenging.
- Alan's Involvement: Alan's request for a body in exchange for a power source adds depth to the alien subplot without giving away too much about the precursor mystery.
- Marguerit's Redemption: Marguerit's help in Robin's quest and her redemption arc provide emotional closure.
- Political Leverage: The evidence against Altera's bioweapon plans being valuable to the Mongolian states adds a realistic political dimension to the story.
- Organic Exploration: The blend of alien and murder mystery plots encourages deeper exploration, tying into the game's core mechanics.
This storyline uses existing assets and provides clear motives for characters, maintaining the game's intrigue without resorting to unrealistic solutions or overly complex explanations.
